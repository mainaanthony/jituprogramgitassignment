#Jitu Program Git lesson

The git is a ditributed version control system

advantages
 collaboration
 allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase
 provide a record of all changes
 easy identification and resolution of conflicts
 facilitates code reviews


git init - used to create a new git repository
git add: add changes to the staging area
git commit: records changes to the repository
git status: shows the status of the repository
git log: displays a log of all commits to the repository

Git workflow

working directory-git add- where files are stored

staging area-git add-changes are prepared for commit
 
repository - where files and changes are stored permanently

Branching and the advantages
  allowed developers to create branches to work on new features or bugs
  they are isolated from the main codebase until they are merged back in
  git merge is used to combine the changes made on the different branches
  git checkout/ git switch: to change the branch for instance git checkout trial would take ys to the branch trial
  git branch trial: creates a new branch called trial
  git merge trial would merge the changes that were in trial to the main branch
